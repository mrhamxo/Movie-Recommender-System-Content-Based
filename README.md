# Movie-Recommender-System-Content-Based

## Project Summary
The Movie Recommender System using a content-based approach is designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and interests. This system analyzes the features of movies that a user has previously liked or rated highly and recommends similar movies. By leveraging various attributes such as genre, director, cast, and plot keywords, the system ensures personalized and relevant movie recommendations, enhancing the user's viewing experience.

## Objectives
1. **Feature Extraction**: Identify and extract relevant features from the movie dataset, including genre, director, cast, and plot keywords.
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Implement a method to calculate the similarity between movies based on the extracted features.
3. **Recommendation Generation**: Develop an algorithm to generate movie recommendations for users based on their past preferences.
4. **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface where users can input their movie preferences and receive recommendations.
